# EBU R 167 related HLG Display Adaptation Calculator

This HLG Display Adaptation Calculator implements the Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) system as specified in
[ITU-R BT.2100](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.2100), with calculations for System Gamma and HDR Reference White following ITU-R BT.2100 Note 5f,
[ITU-R BT.2390 Section 6.2](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BT.2390) and [ITU-R BT.2408 Section 2.1](https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REP-BT.2408) respectively.

The intention is to help users understand more about how the Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) system works.

Two versions are provided:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript version to use directly in a browser.
- Python version for CLI based interaction.

The idea for this tool was inspired by work related to:

- [EBU Recommendation R 167 â€” Reference Monitors: Predefined Modes for HLG](https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/r167)

Credits: Thomas Berglund (NRK) for the concept and implementation.
