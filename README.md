# EBU R 167 related calculator code
HLG Display Adaptation Calculator in both Python and HTML/Javascript.

This HLG Display Adaptation Calculator implements the Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) system as specified in
ITU-R BT.2100, with calculations for system gamma and HDR reference white following ITU-R BT.2100 Note 5f,
ITU-R BT.2390 Section 6.2 and ITU-R BT.2408 Section 2.1 respectively.

The intention is to help users understand more about how the Hybrid Log-Gamma (HLG) system works.

The idea for this tool was inspired by work related to:

- EBU Recommendation R 167 â€” Reference Monitors: Predefined Modes for HLG
